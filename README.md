AzureADRecon is a tool which extracts and combines various artefacts (as highlighted below) out of an Azure AD environment with a valid credential. The information can be presented in a specially formatted Microsoft Excel report that includes summary views with metrics to facilitate analysis and provide a holistic picture of the current state of the target environment.

The tool is useful to various classes of security professionals like auditors, DFIR, students, administrators, etc. It can also be an invaluable post-exploitation tool for a penetration tester.

The tool requires AzureAD PowerShell Module to be installed.

The following information is gathered by the tool:

* Tenant
* Domain
* Licenses
* Users
* ServicePrincipals
* DirectoryRoles
* DirectoryRoleMembers
* Groups
* GroupMembers
* Devices
